I'm on a sugar crash
I ain't got no f**kin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath
Cut my f**kin' brain in half
I'm not lonely just a bit
Tired of this f**king shit
Nothing that I write
can make me
Feel good
Victim of the great machine
In love with everything I see
Neon lights surrounding me
I indulge in luxury
Everything I do is wrong
'Cept for when I hit the bong
Hit the bong
Hit the b-b-b-b-b
Feel good
Feeling shitty in my bed
Didn't take my f**kin' meds
Hyperpop up in my ears
Everything just disappears
Don't wanna be someone else
Just don't wanna hate myself
I just don't wanna hate myself
Instead I wanna feel good
I'm on a sugar crash
I ain't got no f**kin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath
Cut my f**kin' brain in half
I'm not lonely just a bit
Tired of this f**king shit
Nothing that I write
can make me
Feel good
Where to now
Got the rest of my life
just spread out
Got the rest of my life
to f**k around
Got the rest of my life
to make sound
Where to now
Got the rest of my life
just laid out
Got the rest of my life
to f**k around
Got the rest of my life
to make sound
Feel good
